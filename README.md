**Welcome message from the author**

Hi, thank you for visiting this repository. I created this repository to celebrate new year in 2023, and have been updating it to polish my `HTML` skills. This repository includes A to Z of HTML tags, and I am planning to add some examples to practice `HTML` tags. If you want to see my notes on `HTML` linked to `CSS`, please visit this link (jaehoon-sung-css-masterbook)!

Any feedback or comments are sincerely appreciated.

\- Jaehoon Sung (Jae)

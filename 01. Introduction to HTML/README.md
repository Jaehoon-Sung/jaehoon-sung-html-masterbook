## How to build a basic development environment?

If you want to practice the codes I have written in this `HTML` masterbook, you will only need a decent code editor such as `Visual Studio Code` and `Brackets`. I use `Visual Studio Code` for my whole development projects.

If you want to practice the codes in other masterbooks, you will need to install `node.js`. I recommend to install `nvm` first, and then install `node.js` using `nvm`. `nvm` is a tool which manages `node.js` versions installed on your device. The reason why we should install `node.js` using `nvm` is that `nvm` allows us to install and manage many versions of `node.js`. For example, when we work on some development projects, it is common that we use different versions of `node.js` and switch over them. `nvm` helps us switch among these different `node.js` versions easily. The full name of `nvm`, Node Version Manager, might help you understand why we need `nvm` to manage versions of `node.js`! :)

Please see this blog post which explains what `nvm` is and how to install `node.js` using `nvm`!

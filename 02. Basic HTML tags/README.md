# Basic HTML tags

## HTML Structure

Below is the basic but necessary structure of `HTML` file!

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

`<!DOCTYPE html>` makes the browser know that the file is `HTML`! Technically, it gives the browser the information that the document type is `HTML 5`.

FYI : If you want to declare that the document type is older versions of `HTML`, you must use `DTD`, Document Type Definition. For example, if you want to delcare that the document type is `HTML 4.01`, you should write the `<!DOCTYPE>` shown as below.

Example 1 : `<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">`
Example 2 : `<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">`
